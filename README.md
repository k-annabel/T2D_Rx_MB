# T2D_Rx_MB

This repository contains scripts for the statistical analysis of the project "Associations between novel type 2 diabetes medications and gut microbiome". 

Each script loads the necessary packages. The scripts should be run in the order presented. 

The scripts contain the analyses separately. These are: 
1. T2D-Rx_MB - alpha_diversity.R - analyzing the effect of semaglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist) and empagliflozin (SGLT-2 inhibitor) on gut alpha diversity.
2. T2D-Rx_MB - beta_diversity.R - analyzing the effect of semaglutide and empagliflozin on gut beta diversity.
3. T2D-Rx_MB - differential_abundance. R - comparing alterations in prevalent bacterial genera before and after semaglutide and empagliflozin treatment initialization.
4. T2D-Rx_MB - MB_prediction.R - investigating associations between the baseline gut microbiome and changes in treatment markers in the semaglutide and empagliflozin study group.
5. T2D_Rx_MB_analysis.R - preliminary analysis of bidirectional effects between semaglutide and empagliflozin and the gut microbiome.
